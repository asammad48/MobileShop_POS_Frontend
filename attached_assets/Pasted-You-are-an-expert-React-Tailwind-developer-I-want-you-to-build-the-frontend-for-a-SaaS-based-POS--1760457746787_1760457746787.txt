You are an expert React + Tailwind developer. I want you to build the frontend for a SaaS-based POS (Point of Sale) system with multiple user roles.

⚙️ Tech Stack:

React (latest version)
Tailwind CSS
React Router DOM
Axios
Zustand or Redux Toolkit for state management
React Hook Form for forms
Lucide React or Heroicons for icons
Shadcn UI components for clean design
JWT authentication (frontend only, for now simulate role-based access)
🎯 Project Overview: We are building a multi-role SaaS POS application for mobile repair shops and accessory sellers. There are three user roles:

Super Admin
Admin (Shop Owner)
Sales Person (Shopkeeper / POS User)
Each role will have a different dashboard layout and feature access.

🧩 Pages and Features
🔐 Authentication
Login and Signup pages
Simulated JWT-based login (store token and role in localStorage)
Role-based redirection:
Super Admin → /super-admin/dashboard
Admin → /admin/dashboard
Sales Person → /pos
🧭 Main Layout
Modern sidebar + top navbar layout
Responsive design for desktop and tablet
Sidebar menu adjusts based on role
Super Admin Menu:

Dashboard (view total admins, total sales, analytics)
Manage Admins (list, edit, delete, create)
Pricing Plans (add/edit/delete packages)
System Analytics (revenue overview, total shops, active users)
Admin (Shop Owner) Menu:

Dashboard (sales summary, inventory count, shop performance)
Products (CRUD)
Categories (CRUD)
Sales Report (filter by date, staff)
Manage Staff (add/edit/delete sales persons)
Subscription (current plan, renew/upgrade options)
POS Access (redirect to POS page)
Sales Person (POS) Menu:

POS Dashboard
Create New Sale
View Recent Sales
Products lookup
💳 POS Page Features
Dual input method:
Barcode Scanner Integration → auto fills product details
Manual Entry → search product by name, edit quantity, and price
Cart system with add/remove/edit
Realtime total calculation (subtotal, tax, discount, grand total)
“Print Receipt” and “Complete Sale” buttons
Clean, tablet-friendly UI for quick use
Show stock warnings when product quantity is low
💰 Pricing Module (Super Admin Side)
Manage subscription tiers (e.g., Silver, Gold, Platinum)
Display plan features, price, and limits (no. of staff, no. of products, etc.)
Admin can view and upgrade their plan
📊 UI / Design Requirements
Modern SaaS-style dashboard (like Linear, Stripe, or Vercel UI)
Use Tailwind + Shadcn UI components
Rounded corners, soft shadows, consistent spacing
Light theme
Dashboard cards with gradient headers and icons
Use dummy JSON data for now (to simulate API)
🧠 State & Auth
Store JWT + user role in localStorage
Add a simple hook useAuth() to check role and protect routes
Each protected route should redirect unauthorized users to /login

🧑‍💻 Development Goals
Build reusable components (Sidebar, Navbar, DashboardCard, Modal, Table)
Use Tailwind classes properly for spacing and typography
Simulate backend using static JSON or mock API
Keep code clean and modular for easy backend integration later
🚀 Output Expectation
Generate all base files and folder structure. Include routing, UI screens for each role, and dummy JSON data for sample views. Focus on UX — make it visually appealing and functional. Use dummy JWT logic for role-based routing.

🧾 Summary:
Build the frontend only for a SaaS POS app using React + Tailwind. It should include authentication, dashboards for each role, a POS page (with barcode/manual input), and a pricing management module for super admin. Make it modern, clean, and production-ready in UI/UX.
